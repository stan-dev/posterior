Description: Provides useful tools for both users and developers of packages 
  for fitting Bayesian models or working with output from Bayesian models. 
  The primary goals of the package are to: 
  (a) Efficiently convert between many different useful formats of
  draws (samples) from posterior or prior distributions.
  (b) Provide consistent methods for operations commonly performed on draws, 
  for example, subsetting, binding, or mutating draws.
  (c) Provide various summaries of draws in convenient formats.
  (d) Provide lightweight implementations of state of the art posterior 
  inference diagnostics.
