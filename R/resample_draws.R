#' Resample `draws` objects
#'
#' Resample [`draws`] objects according to provided weights, for example weights
#' obtained through importance sampling.
#'
#' @template args-methods-x
#' @param weights (numeric vector) A vector of positive weights of length
#'   `ndraws(x)`. The weights will be internally normalized. If `weights` is not
#'   specified, an attempt will be made to extract any weights already stored in
#'   the draws object (via [weight_draws()]). If no weights are stored in the
#'   draws object, equal weight is supplied to each draw. How exactly the
#'   weights influence the resampling depends on the `method` argument.
#' @param method (string) The resampling method to use:
#'  * `"simple"`: simple random resampling with replacement
#'  * `"simple_no_replace"`: simple random resampling without replacement
#'  * `"stratified"`: stratified resampling with replacement
#'  * `"deterministic"`: deterministic resampling with replacement
#'
#'  Currently, `"stratified"` is the default as it has comparably low variance
#'  and bias with respect to ideal resampling. The latter would sample perfectly
#'  proportional to the weights, but this is not possible in practice due to the
#'  finite number of draws available. For more details about resampling methods,
#'  see Kitagawa (1996).
#' @param ndraws (positive integer) The number of draws to be returned. By
#'   default `ndraws` is set internally to the total number of draws in `x` if
#'   sensible.
#' @template args-methods-dots
#' @template return-draws
#'
#' @details Upon usage of `resample_draws()`, chains will automatically be merged
#'   due to subsetting of individual draws (see [`subset_draws`] for details).
#'   Also, weights stored in the `draws` object will be removed in the process,
#'   as resampling invalidates existing weights.
