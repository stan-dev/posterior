\title{Bulk effective sample size (bulk-ESS)}
\usage{
ess_bulk(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array \emph{without} warmup draws (# iter * # chains).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value for the bulk effective sample size.
}
\description{
Compute bulk effective sample size estimate (bulk-ESS) for one parameter.
Bulk-ESS is useful as a generic diagnostic for the sampling
efficiency in the bulk of the posterior. It is defined as the
effective sample size for rank normalized values using split chains.
