\title{Effective sample size for the mean}
\usage{
ess_mean(x, ...)

\method{ess_mean}{default}(x, weights = NULL, ...)

\method{ess_mean}{rvar}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(multiple options) One of:
\itemize{
\item A matrix of draws for a single variable (iterations x chains). See
\code{\link[=extract_variable_matrix]{extract_variable_matrix()}}.
\item An \code{\link{rvar}}.
}}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).}

\item{weights}{(numeric vector) A vector of weights of length \code{ndraws(x)},
or \code{NULL} to not have weights. Note that if \code{x} is an \code{rvar} with weights, they are used instead of this argument.}
}
\value{
If the input is an array, returns a single numeric value. If any of the draws
is non-finite, that is, \code{NA}, \code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output
will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if all draws within any of the chains of a
variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}
as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant draws, we cannot
distinguish between variables that are supposed to be constant (e.g., a
diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or variables that just
happened to be constant because of a failure of convergence or other problems
in the sampling process.

If the input is an \code{\link{rvar}}, returns an array of the same dimensions as the
\code{\link{rvar}}, where each element is equal to the value that would be returned by
passing the draws array for that element of the \code{\link{rvar}} to this function.

Compute an effective sample size estimate for a mean (expectation)
estimate of a single variable.
