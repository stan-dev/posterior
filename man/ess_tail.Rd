\title{Tail effective sample size (tail-ESS)}
\usage{
ess_tail(x, ...)

\method{ess_tail}{default}(x, weights = NULL, ...)

\method{ess_tail}{rvar}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(multiple options) One of:
\itemize{
\item A matrix of draws for a single variable (iterations x chains). See
\code{\link[=extract_variable_matrix]{extract_variable_matrix()}}.
\item An \code{\link{rvar}}.
}}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).}

\item{weights}{(numeric vector) A vector of weights of length \code{ndraws(x)},
or \code{NULL} to not have weights. Note that if \code{x} is an \code{rvar} with weights, they are used instead of this argument.}
}
\value{
If the input is an array, returns a single numeric value. If any of the draws
is non-finite, that is, \code{NA}, \code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output
will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if all draws within any of the chains of a
variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}
as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant draws, we cannot
distinguish between variables that are supposed to be constant (e.g., a
diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or variables that just
happened to be constant because of a failure of convergence or other problems
in the sampling process.

If the input is an \code{\link{rvar}}, returns an array of the same dimensions as the
\code{\link{rvar}}, where each element is equal to the value that would be returned by
passing the draws array for that element of the \code{\link{rvar}} to this function.
}
\description{
Compute a tail effective sample size estimate (tail-ESS) for a single
variable. Tail-ESS is useful as a diagnostic for the sampling efficiency in
the tails of the posterior. It is defined as the minimum of the effective
sample sizes for 5\% and 95\% quantiles. For the bulk effective sample
size see \code{\link[=ess_bulk]{ess_bulk()}}. See Vehtari (2021) for an in-depth
comparison of different effective sample size estimators.
If computed on a weighted \code{rvar}, weights will be
taken into account.
